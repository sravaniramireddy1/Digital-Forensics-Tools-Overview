# üîç Digital Forensics Lab ‚Äì Experiment 5  
**Use Autopsy to Create a Case and Import Evidence**

---

## üìå Objective
To understand how to use **Autopsy**, an open-source digital forensics tool, for creating a case, importing evidence, and analyzing forensic artifacts.

---

## üìù Description
Autopsy is an open-source digital forensics platform used for analyzing and extracting data from digital devices.  
In this experiment, we performed the following steps:

1. **Installation** of Autopsy.  
2. **Creating a New Case** with examiner details.  
3. **Adding a Data Source** (evidence image file).  
4. **Configuring Ingest Modules** for automated analysis.  
5. **Performing Analysis** (keyword search, file system, hash lookup, timeline).  
6. **Generating a Report** of findings.  
7. **Closing and Archiving** the case.

## üìÇ Steps with Screenshots

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Opening Autopsy and Creating a Case
- Launch Autopsy ‚Üí Select **New Case**.  
- Provide case name, location, and examiner details.

![Step 1 ‚Äì Create Case](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b89fa7a1-b593-4be5-a596-5f22a524d953)

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Adding a Data Source
- Choose the type of evidence (disk image, logical files, or local drive).  
- Browse and select the image file (e.g., `.E01` format).

![Step 2 ‚Äì Add Data Source](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aad384dc-5f5f-4553-b652-219baf2dc09c)

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Configuring Ingest Modules
- Enable modules like **File Type Identification, Keyword Search, Hash Lookup, Web Artifacts**.  
- These modules automatically extract forensic artifacts.
